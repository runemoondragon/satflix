---

- **BTC Receiving Address / LN Invoice ID:**

---

### 3. Tiered Tranche Terms

This agreement is part of a publicly-disclosed, tiered fundraising structure implemented by the Vooomo project. The total target raise for this round is **$500,000 to $1,000,000 USD equivalent in BTC**, representing up to **10% equity** in the future incorporated entity.

#### Tier 1 ‚Äì Early Backers

- **Contribution Amount:** $1,000 USD (BTC equivalent)  
- **SAFE Equity Rights:** Full SAFE (1.0x equity)  
- **Token Rights:** Full token allocation  
- **Valuation Cap:** $5,000,000  
- **Total Units Available:** 500

#### Tier 2 ‚Äì Booster Round

- **Contribution Amount:** $500 USD (BTC equivalent)  
- **SAFE Equity Rights:** Half SAFE (0.5x equity)  
- **Token Rights:** Half token allocation  
- **Valuation Cap:** $7,500,000  
- **Total Units Available:** TBD

#### Tier 3 ‚Äì Final Tier

- **Contribution Amount:** $250 USD (BTC equivalent)  
- **SAFE Equity Rights:** Quarter SAFE (0.25x equity)  
- **Token Rights:** Quarter token allocation  
- **Valuation Cap:** $10,000,000  
- **Total Units Available:** TBD

Each funding tranche includes a limited number of digital inscriptions minted via Bitcoin (Ordinals protocol), each representing a specific contribution tier and corresponding investor rights. Each inscription is immutable and tied to the public wallet address that holds it. If the funding goal is reached before subsequent tranches are activated, no further inscriptions will be minted.

The rights associated with each tier are explicitly defined at the time of inscription and encoded in both metadata and the Contributor Ledger.

---

### 4. Binding Terms Per Tier

The SAFE and Token Warrant rights granted in this agreement are explicitly determined by the **Tier at which the contribution was made**, and shall not be retroactively adjusted.

The Vooomo project reserves the right to:

- Close fundraising upon reaching target  
- Adjust future tranche terms before minting  
- Publicly publish all ledger entries, including wallet IDs and inscription IDs

---

### üìò Example Scenario (Including Token Calculations)

A Tier 1 contributor inscribes a $1,000 contribution under a $5M valuation cap. Upon incorporation, this entitles them to:

- **An equity share reflecting the $5M cap**
- **A token allocation of 20,000 $VOO**, based on the calculation:
  \[(1,000 √ó 100,000,000) / 5,000,000 = 20,000 Tokens]

If a contributor joins later under Tier 2, with a $500 contribution at a $7.5M cap, they receive:

- **Reduced equity rights (0.5x SAFE)**
- **A token allocation of 6,666 $VOO**, calculated as:
  \[(500 √ó 100,000,000) / 7,500,000 = 6,666 Tokens]

And for Tier 3, a $250 contribution at a $10M cap results in:

- **Quarter SAFE equity rights**
- **A token allocation of 2,500 $VOO**, calculated as:
  \[(250 √ó 100,000,000) / 10,000,000 = 2,500 Tokens]

This structure incentivizes early participation and rewards contributors who commit capital during the most formative phase of the project.

---

### 5. No Guarantees

The Contributor understands and agrees:

- This is a **high-risk, experimental project**  
- The token has **not yet been issued**  
- There is **no guarantee of profits, returns, or resale value**  
- This SAFE is **not a public offering** and may be classified as a security depending on jurisdiction

---

### 6. Rights of the Contributor

Until conversion:

- No voting rights  
- No claim to assets  
- No right to demand a refund

Upon conversion:

- Contributor becomes a shareholder and token holder with pro-rata rights

---

### 7. Future Governance

Contributor agrees to participate in future governance mechanisms (e.g. Bitboard.me) according to the open-source ruleset governing the Vooomo ecosystem.

---

### 8. Legal Jurisdiction

- Governing Law: [to be determined at incorporation, e.g. Delaware, Wyoming]  
- In absence of legal incorporation, all disputes will be resolved via public forum (e.g. GitHub, online arbitration).
