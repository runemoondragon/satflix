            A Love Letter to the Lawmakers and Content Owners: Why We Should Exist
          </h1>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">Dear Guardians of Creativity and Digital Fairness,</p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We exist because the world of content consumption is broken. Not by the creators, nor by the rightful ownersâ€”but by a system that rewards piracy and punishes accessibility.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            For too long, legitimate content owners have been forced to fight an endless battle against piracyâ€”cease-and-desist letters, lawsuits, takedowns, domain seizuresâ€”only to see new pirate sites emerge the very next day.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">And why?</p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Because the true problem has never been piracy itself, but the economic model that fuels it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Piracy exists because users want affordable, instant access to content, and traditional platforms have failed to provide that at a global scale. Subscription fees, geo-restrictions, and outdated licensing models leave millions of potential viewers out in the cold, forcing them to turn to free ad-funded piracy sites that profit not from creativity, but from exploitation.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            These sites do not pay creators, do not compensate filmmakers, and do not care about artistic integrity.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            They profit from clickbait ads, malware injections, and tracking systems that exploit users' data. They turn the hard work of artists and production teams into fuel for their advertising revenue enginesâ€”all while legitimate content owners watch their earnings disappear.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">But what if we told you there's another way?</p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
            What if we told you we could dismantle piracyâ€”not by legal fights, but by making it financially unviable?
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">
            We Are Not the Enemy. We Are the Disruption Piracy Never Expected.
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We exist to starve piracy from the insideâ€”by removing its primary source of income.
